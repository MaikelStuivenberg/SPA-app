  "rulesRespectText": "At this camp we respect each other, no matter how different we all are. Practically, this means that you consider everyone valuable and that everyone is worth getting to know. In rehearsals, workshops and other activities, everyone has their own opinion (or is forming it) and we prefer an honest answer to the correct one. Furthermore, we respect nature, the employees of Belmont and the leaders of SPA. Together we keep the buildings and the campsite clean of litter and do not have water fights in the buildings.\nPossession and use of alcohol, tobacco, drugs and energy drinks is not allowed throughout the week inside and outside the campsite.",

  "rulesUnityText": "We form one group together. No one is left out. The boat is big enough. We don't bully each other. We dare to get to know new people. We dare to let other people get to know us. Everyone big or small, fat or thin, tough or shy; everyone is equally valuable in God's eyes and God loves everyone just as much. Together we do our utmost to ensure that nothing stands in the way of this.\nWe do nothing that endangers ourselves or others.\nEach participant must be present at each organized program component. The only exception is if you have received permission from the management for this.\nMobile phones, game consoles, laptops, tablets and the like are not used during activities out of respect for each other, for guests and the leaders of the various activities.",

  "rulesSafetyText": "A safe environment at camp is important. We mean two forms of safety. Firstly, safely handling oneself, others, materials, and buildings. Additionally, the safety that allows you to be who you are and feel comfortable during the camp.\nLeaving the campsite on your own initiative is not allowed! Furthermore, in case of fire or any other emergency, you should follow the instructions of the leaders.\nMedications that you need will be collected by the leaders at the beginning of the week and provided to you during the week.\nBeing in the sleeping quarters or bathroom of the opposite gender is not allowed. Additionally, during the day, you should not be unnecessarily in your tent or dormitory, but you should be there at night.\nSleep is important for your safety and health. Therefore, between 12:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., it should be quiet on the premises. In the tent camps, it should be quiet from 11:00 p.m. onwards.",

The leaders at this camp are here especially for you. This can be the leaders of your group, but also any other leaders. We would like to listen to you, talk to you or (if you want) pray with you.\nIf you have a problem, discuss it with your group leader or with the head leader of the camp.\n",

  "welcomeText": "This year marks the 75th edition of SPA. What a time and what a milestone that is. Throughout all these years, there have been many footprints left in Belmont by all the participants who have taken part in the camp. Perhaps your own footprint, or that of your parents or other family members. They all experienced beautiful moments there, made memories, and somehow left a footprint behind.\nNow, let this year's theme be about \"Footprint\".\nNo, it's not just about the previous 74 editions of SPA, nor is it solely about sustainability. Both themes naturally come into play this year.\nWe will start on Saturday with the REUNION of 75 years of SPA, where we will have the opportunity to meet many former participants and leaders. Throughout the week, we will also focus on sustainability, with a meatless meal and even vegetarian snacks. With this year's theme of Footprint, we will primarily look at some important people in the Bible and what they left behind. But we will also contemplate who you are or want to be, and what you want to leave behind: your own footprint!\n\nWe wish you a lot of fun!\nMichel & Roel"
