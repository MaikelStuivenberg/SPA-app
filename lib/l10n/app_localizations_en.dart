Additionally, during the day, you should not be unnecessarily in your tent or dormitory, but you should be there at night.\nSleep is important for your safety and health.

Perhaps your own footprint, or that of your parents or other family members. They all experienced beautiful moments there, made memories, and somehow left a footprint behind.\nNow, let this year\'s theme be about \"Footprint\".\nNo, it\'s not just about the previous 74 editions of SPA, nor is it solely about sustainability. Both themes naturally come into play this year.\nWe will start on Saturday with the REUNION of 75 years of SPA, where we will have the opportunity to meet many former participants and leaders. Throughout the week, we will also focus on sustainability, with a meatless meal and even vegetarian snacks. With this year\'s theme of Footprint, we will primarily look at some important people in the Bible and what they left behind. But we will also contemplate who you are or want to be, and what you want to leave behind: your own footprint!\n\nWe wish you a lot of fun!\nMichel & Roel';
